# DenoisingGW
This repo includes raw code for denoising gravitational waves


The implementation is based on paper: [Denoising Gravitational Waves with Enhanced Deep Recurrent Denoising Auto-Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03105)


The code clean up is in progress. Currently the dataset part is missing. However, the placeholder for the data inputs are there.


1. functions.py includes all necessary functions for building up the model
2. trainer.py includes the main training and testing functions
